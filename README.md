# Project_1: Data Analysis Based on Business Questions

This project involves data analysis based on specific business questions, including data manipulation and cleaning. The analysis was initially performed in Python, using various libraries to explore and interpret the data. After the initial analysis, the data was imported into Power BI to enable a more complete and interactive visualization of the indicators.

## Project Objectives

- **Explore the dataset:** Conduct exploratory analysis to better understand the data structure and identify patterns and trends.
- **Clean and manipulate data:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring quality and consistency.
- **Analyze indicators:** Calculate and interpret key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business questions.
- **Visualize results:** Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports that facilitate decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Python Libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn.
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and creating interactive reports.

## Installation and Imports

To reproduce this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Python:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Install the Required Libraries:**
    - numpy: `pip install numpy`
    - pandas: `pip install pandas`
    - matplotlib.pyplot: `pip install matplotlib`
    - seaborn: `pip install seaborn`
3. **Install Power BI:** [Download Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)

## Project Structure

1. **Exploratory Analysis:** The initial analysis of the dataset was performed in Python, using numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn to explore the data and generate preliminary visualizations.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning and manipulation processes to ensure the data is ready for analysis and visualization.
3. **Indicator Analysis:** Calculation and interpretation of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the business questions.
4. **Power BI Visualization:** Import the cleaned data into Power BI and create interactive dashboards that present the analysis results clearly and accessibly.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script to perform the initial data analysis.
3. Import the cleaned data file into Power BI.
4. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI to view the interactive dashboards and reports.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of data analysis in answering business questions and making informed decisions. By using powerful tools like Python and Power BI, it was possible to transform raw data into valuable insights that can help guide business strategies and actions.
